# Finance Tracker

A full-stack personal finance tracking application built with Python and Streamlit.  
The app allows users to record income and expenses, view transaction history, and analyze monthly spending through interactive dashboards.

This project focuses on **clean data modeling, modular application architecture, and real-world deployment practices**, rather than complex frontend frameworks.
